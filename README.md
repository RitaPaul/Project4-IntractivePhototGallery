# Project4-IntractivePhototGallery
In this project an interactive photo gallery is created using JavaScript and JQuery. At the top of the page is a searchable area where photos will hide and show depending on user's input. When the user clicks on thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox and a back and a next arrow to cycle through photos.
